MetaGenomic Analysis Scripts.

This is a small suite of R scripts I am developing in order to automate analysis of metagenomic read-mapping data.

The naming of the scripts attempt to exaplain their intended function:
matrix2XXX		expects a matrix with either raw or relative abundances
matrixinfo2XXX		expect a raw read count matrix followed by a few columns of information including feature/gene length
countmatrix2XXX		expects raw read counts in order to work
